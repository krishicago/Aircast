Air quality Prediction

Aircast prediction involves using mathematical models and statistical algorithms to forecast the levels of pollutants in the air at a given time and location. This prediction can be based on factors such as weather patterns, emissions from factories and transportation, and other environmental factors which are available in the aws public cloud. First, it helps to provide advance warning to individuals and authorities about potential air quality problems.This mainly allows people to take precautions to protect their health, such as staying indoors or wearing masks.
